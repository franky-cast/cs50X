If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, audio aura could be characterized by representing
the average of the genres with different colors.

Although this could be one method of characterizing the aura, it might not be accurately representative of the listener
due to chance. Perhaps the user was using his spotify to DJ for others and was not listening to those songs by himself.

Better ways of calculating this aura would be to analyze the time spent listening to each genre and how many times the
songs were listened to.
